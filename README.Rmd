## Abstract

Although the advent of online consumer panels has reduced the cost of data collection for survey-based marketing research projects, it has introduced a whole host of additional problems that must be addressed in order to make valid inference.Central to these concerns are issues related to respondent quality. In this paper we introduce a new technology, mouse tracking, that allows for passive surveillance of mouse movements. Prior research has shown that these movements can be linked to a variety of psychological states including engagement, conflict, and affect.We show through a series of experiments that mouse tracking can be used to assess respondent engagement.
