Dynamically Assessing Respondent Quality in Conjoint Studies
================

## Abstract

Although the advent of online consumer panels has reduced the cost of
data collection for survey-based marketing research projects, it has
introduced a whole host of additional problems that must be addressed in
order to make valid inference.Central to these concerns are issues
related to respondent quality. In this paper we introduce a new
technology, mouse tracking, that allows for passive surveillance of
mouse movements. Prior research has shown that these movements can be
linked to a variety of psychological states including engagement,
conflict, and affect.We show through a series of experiments that mouse
tracking can be used to assess respondent engagement.
